ðŸ”— **Live Demo:** [https://smart-summary-app.vercel.app/](https://smart-summary-app.vercel.app/)

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a modern microservices architecture with clear separation between the frontend and backend components:

    â”œâ”€â”€ components/    # Reusable UI components
    â””â”€â”€ lib/           # Utility functions
```

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with FastAPI and follows these architectural principles:

1. **RESTful API**
   - RESTful endpoints for all operations
   - JWT-based authentication for secure access
   - Rate limiting to prevent abuse

2. **AI Provider Abstraction**
   - Provider-agnostic design supporting multiple AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
   - Easy to add new AI providers through the base provider interface
   - Consistent response format across different providers

3. **Scalability**
   - Stateless design for horizontal scaling
   - Asynchronous request handling for better performance
   - Connection pooling for database access

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built with Next.js and features:

1. **Modern React Patterns**
   - Server Components for better performance
   - Client-side state management with React hooks
   - Responsive design with Tailwind CSS

2. **API Integration**
   - Type-safe API clients
   - Error handling and loading states
   - Real-time updates with Server-Sent Events (SSE)

3. **User Experience**
   - Typewriter effect for AI responses
   - Responsive layout for all device sizes
   - Accessible UI components

## Key Assumptions

1. **Deployment**
   - Backend is deployed with public API access
   - Frontend is served through a CDN for optimal performance
   - Environment variables are properly configured for each environment

2. **Security**
   - API tokens are securely stored and never exposed to the client
   - Rate limiting is in place to prevent abuse
   - Input validation is performed on both client and server

3. **Performance**
   - AI provider responses are streamed for better perceived performance
   - Frontend implements proper loading states and error boundaries
   - Assets are optimized for fast loading

4. **Error Handling**
   - Comprehensive error handling at all layers
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Logging and monitoring in place

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ for frontend
- Python 3.8+ for backend
- MongoDB for data persistence
- API keys for AI providers

### Development Setup

1. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your configuration
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cp .env.local.example .env.local
   # Edit .env.local with your configuration
   npm run dev
   ```

## Deployment

### Backend

Deploy the FastAPI application using:
- Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers
- Behind a reverse proxy (Nginx/Apache)
- Environment variables for configuration

### Frontend

Deploy the Next.js application using:
- Vercel (recommended)
- Next.js standalone output
- Environment variables in the deployment platform

## Scaling and Security Considerations

### Scaling Strategies

#### Horizontal Scaling
- **Stateless Architecture**
  - Design services to be stateless where possible
  - Store session data in distributed cache (Redis)
  - Use sticky sessions only when necessary

#### Caching Layers
- **Multi-level Caching**
  - Edge caching with CDN for static assets

#### Asynchronous Processing
- **Background Jobs**
  - Offload long-running tasks to background workers
  - Implement job queues (Redis, RabbitMQ)
  - Use WebSockets for real-time updates

### Security Considerations

#### Authentication & Authorization
- **JWT Implementation**
  - Short-lived access tokens with refresh tokens
  - Secure token storage (HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite)
  - Role-based access control (RBAC)

#### API Security
- **Rate Limiting**
  - Implement rate limiting by IP and user
  - Consider different limits for different endpoints
  - Use exponential backoff for rate limit responses

- **Input Validation**
  - Validate all user inputs on both client and server
  - Use strong typing and schema validation
  - Sanitize all outputs to prevent XSS

#### Data Protection
- **Encryption**
  - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
  - Use TLS 1.3 for all communications
  - Implement proper key management

- **Data Privacy**
  - Implement data minimization principles
  - Regular data audits and cleanup
  - Data retention policies

#### Infrastructure Security
- **Network Security**
  - Use VPC and private subnets where possible
  - Implement Web Application Firewall (WAF)
  - Regular security audits and penetration testing

- **Secrets Management**
  - Rotate API keys and credentials regularly

#### Monitoring and Logging
- **Security Monitoring**
  - Centralized logging with sensitive data redaction
  - Real-time alerting for suspicious activities
  - Regular security audits

- **Compliance**
  - Regular security assessments
  - Documentation of security practices
  - Incident response plan
